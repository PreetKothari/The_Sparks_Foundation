## The Sparks Foundation

### Data Science and Business Analytics Intern under GRIP (Graduate Rotational Internship Program ) August 2021 
 
I have put all te tasks done by me during my internship at the sparks foundation. The various tasks revolve around different machine learning and data visualization concepts and their implementation on various datasets. The following were the area of concerns:
* Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis and proper Visualizations
* Application of various ML algorithms
* Model Evaluation
 
The list of the tasks completed are as follows:
### Task 1- Prediction using Supervised ML
#### Dataset used:-http://bit.ly/w-data
In this task, using simple Linear regression Algorithm the scores of a student were predicted based on the numberof hours he/she put in to study per day.
 
### Task 2- Prediction using Unsupervised ML
#### Dataset used:- https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
In this task, KNN Algorithm was implemented to predict the optimum noumber of clusters using Elbow Method on the 'Iris' dataset. To get better essence of the data, various plots and visualizations were also used.
